## About ME

I am currently a Bechelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Research interests include LLM (Large Language Model), CV (computer vison), and Embodied AI. Engaged in MEICC(2025) and gained National World Prize. I hold TÜV Rheinland Aritificial Intelligence Engineer Certification by TÜV Rheinland and Industrial and Information Technology Talent Job Capability Certification by MIIT of China.

## Research Interests

- Anomaly Detection in Robotic Vision:
 Robust perception under complex conditions (e.g., multi-illumination, 360° omnidirectional vision) for industrial inspection and autonomous robots.
- Machine Learning: 
 Focus on supervised/self-supervised learning, feature engineering, and model optimization for engineering-oriented AI applications.
- Multi-modal AIGC:
 Cross-modal content generation (image, text, sensor data) and its integration with robotic perception systems to improve environmental understanding.
