## About ME

I am currently a Bechelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). With a solid foundation in AI theory and hands-on engineering experience, I hold the TÜV Rheinland Aritificial Intelligence Engineer Certification and am the National First Prize winner of the 2025 MEICC.

## Research Interests

- Anomaly Detection in Robotic Vision:
 Robust perception under complex conditions (e.g., multi-illumination, 360° omnidirectional vision) for industrial inspection and autonomous robots.
- Machine Learning: 
 Focus on supervised/self-supervised learning, feature engineering, and model optimization for engineering-oriented AI applications.
- Multi-modal AIGC:
 Cross-modal content generation (image, text, sensor data) and its integration with robotic perception systems to improve environmental understanding.
