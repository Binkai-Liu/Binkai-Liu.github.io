In this speech, I emphasize that achieving carbon neutrality—a critical global issue transcending geographical boundaries—relies heavily on the youth of China and France to shape a sustainable future. First, at the individual level, the youth’s lifestyle choices (e.g., using public transport, saving food, adopting clean energy, choosing eco-friendly products, and reducing waste) are highlighted by me as impactful in driving market trends and cutting carbon footprints. Second, for society, I urge the youth to raise public awareness and advocate for supportive policies: leveraging social media to voice concerns, organizing/participating in community education, volunteer activities, and environmental campaigns (I cite UNICEF’s “Green Rising” movement, where youth lead carbon neutrality efforts via education, skill-building, and opportunity creation) to influence social behavior and eventually government policies. Lastly, I stress that substantial change depends on professional development and technological innovation—youth, standing at the crossroads of traditional practices and future aspirations, must learn and innovate to advance technologies like renewable energy, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and green building, which I note require theoretical and practical exploration to unlock sustainable solutions. In conclusion, I underscore that youth do not merely inherit the Earth but borrow it from future generations, bearing heavy responsibility for building a sustainable world; expressing great confidence in Chinese and French youth, I assert that joint action starting now will contribute to a sustainable future.​
