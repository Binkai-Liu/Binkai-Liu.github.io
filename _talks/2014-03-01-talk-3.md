As a capstone talk, this presentation explored emerging trends in generative AI—focusing on multimodal VLMs and their integration into embedded systems. I shared insights from recent projects that combine Python/C++ programming, mathematical statistics, and prompt engineering to build end-to-end intelligent systems. Drawing on PNX robot team’s embedded development experience and academic research methodologies, I discussed challenges in scaling generative AI for resource-constrained devices and proposed solutions rooted in model optimization and prompt refinement. The talk also emphasized creative problem-solving in design and storytelling—showcasing how generative AI can transform user experiences in robotics, media, and beyond. Attendees gained a forward-looking perspective on balancing technical rigor (paradigms like transformer/diffusion) with user-centric design, informed by years of hands-on practice and research.
