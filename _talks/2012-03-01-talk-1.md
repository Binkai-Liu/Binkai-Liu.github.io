Building on embedded development expertise from HKUST’s PNX robot team, this talk explored the intersection of generative AI and intelligent robotics. I demonstrated how Python/C++ programming skills enable seamless integration of diffusion models and VLMs into embedded systems—showcasing a prototype that uses prompt engineering to generate real-time visual feedback for robotic tasks. The presentation also highlighted scientific research methodologies applied during my undergraduate studies, including data analysis pipelines powered by mathematical and statistical foundations. Attendees learned practical strategies for overcoming resource constraints in embedding generative AI, with insights into closed-source API optimization and custom model adaptation.
